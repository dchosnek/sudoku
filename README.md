# Sudoku

This repo contains notebooks for attempting to solve Sudoku puzzles algorithmically (`sudoku_numpy.ipynb`) and via brute force (`brute_force_sudoku.ipynb`). The brute force method is faster and more reliable for difficult puzzles. The algorithms I coded from reading various strategies on different blogs combine to solve easy and medium puzzles, but cannot solve many hard puzzles.
